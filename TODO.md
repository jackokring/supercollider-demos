## Just so I Don't Forget

  * Effects, and boxes.
  * In mutes and channel release.
  * Much better drum sound *SynthDef*.
  * MIDI sync and perhaps SMPTE.
  * Load and save in machines and as complete.
  * Control updates on MIDI? And or bus restore.
  * Longer sequencing?
  * Window position saving.
  * Testing.
  * Unity 1.0 bus levels on audio.
  
And then maybe plan some more machines, and a window to front set control.
