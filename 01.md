## General Hi

A synth. FM style with some good default options. The top line is the main transport, and tempo control along with a machine
volume, and two for emphisis effect knobs called 'stiple' and 'buzz'.

  * Stiple - Alters the sub harmonic harmonic content, and the filter frequency for some AM like things.
  * Buzz - Alters the main carrier oscillator with some feedback.
  
The next row is the filter, with a unique Q plate doubler, and low cut too, and the 4 sub harmonics which due to Fermat, are
good at FM spreading to octave sub divisions of the fundemental. All on high together there is quite a din. Very good with
modulation.

The third row is the note step tunning, and is scaled in semitones. Easy.

The fourth row is note on with 4 different envelopes. Quite versatile, but by no means a full ADSR.

THIS MACHINE ALWAYS STAYS ON TOP, AND IS GLOBAL WINDOW CLOSE.
