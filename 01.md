## General Hi

A synth. FM style with some good default options. The top line is the main transport, and tempo control along with a machine
volume, and two for emphisis effect knobs called 'stiple' and 'buzz'.

  * Stiple - Alters the sub harmonic harmonic content, and the filter frequency for some AM like things.
  * Buzz - Alters the main carrier oscillator with some feedback.
  
The next row is the filter, with a unique Q plate doubler, and low cut too, and the 4 sub harmonics which due to Fermat, are
good at FM spreading to octave sub divisions of the fundemental. All on high together there is quite a din. Very good with
modulation.

The third row is the note step tunning, and is scaled in semitones. Easy.

The fourth row is note on with 4 different envelopes. Quite versatile, but by no means a full ADSR.

The most recent modifications are selecting the buzz ratio. Cool. The buzz control feeds a secondary oscillator into the subz
path. The frequency this is set to implies much character on the machine. The stipple controls much of the self feedback
in the sub harmonic oscillators, as they are then fed into the main oscillator. But buzz feeds a ratio secondary oscillator
modulated by the subz, into the main oscillator leading to a subtle application of the subz.

The exact reason why certain ratios sound fantastic and others don't is based on the FM Bessel expansions of the signal
models. The matalic inharmonic golden ratio does sound excellent with SH5, and this is thought to be due to some rim
5th harmonic, but does give metal sounding other SH settings. So I eventually settled on cos(2*pi/17) as the ratio.

Surprisingly this does not give a metallic character, and in general gets raspy. I think the Q plate can do the metal. Also
picking a root expessable cosine as a modulator, likely has many trigonometric interactions in the Bessel series. I could
go on, but I suggest you get twisty on the buzz for effect. 

THIS MACHINE ALWAYS STAYS ON TOP, AND IS GLOBAL WINDOW CLOSE.
