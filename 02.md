The LFO control, a MIDI bus selector and a tempo multiplier are here. The LFO duration, and simple LFO modulation options.
The second row is pure envelope modulation. Some of the controls have a polar action, and some just reduce the effective
applied control on *General Hi* for some good dynamics.

The third row is a divide by 8 note offset for a 64 beat pattern. Almost simple. The final row does 4 various step changes
by playing the notes in an 8 step in differing orders. Try them. A very simple box.
